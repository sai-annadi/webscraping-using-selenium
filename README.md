Web scraping using Selenium with ChromeDriver offers a powerful and flexible solution for browser automation and data extraction from websites that require JavaScript rendering. Selenium is a widely-used web scraping library that allows developers to simulate user interactions with websites, such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and navigating through pages. ChromeDriver, an integral part of Selenium, facilitates the integration of the Chrome browser for scraping dynamic content.
